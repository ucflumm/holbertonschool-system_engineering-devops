## Specifics about the Infrastructure:
##### 1. Adding Additional Server:
    An extra server is introduced to isolate each major component (web server, application server, and database) onto its own dedicated machine. This segregation helps in resource optimization, security, and performance tuning for specific functions.
##### 2. Load Balancer Cluster:
    The load balancers (HAProxy) are configured as a cluster to work together and distribute incoming traffic among the servers more efficiently. Clustering improves fault tolerance and scalability.

### Reasons for Adding Components:
##### 1. Dedicated Servers for Components:
    Isolating the web server, application server, and database onto individual servers allows for better resource allocation, scalability, and security. It also facilitates easier maintenance and upgrades.

##### 2. Clustered Load Balancers:
    Using load balancers in a cluster ensures that traffic distribution remains seamless even if one load balancer fails. It improves the system's fault tolerance and load handling capacity.


This scaled-up infrastructure provides more resilience, scalability, and better resource management by separating components onto dedicated servers and clustering load balancers for enhanced reliability and load distribution.
