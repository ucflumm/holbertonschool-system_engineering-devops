Additional Explanations:
A server is generally located in a data center:
	Typically, servers are housed in data centers designed to provide security, cooling, power, and 	networking for these systems.

A server can be physical or virtual:
	Servers can be physical machines or virtual instances running on a larger physical server.
	Virtualization allows multiple virtual servers to run on a single physical machine.

A server runs an OS:
	The server operates using an operating system (such as Linux, Windows, etc.) that manages 
	hardware resources and provides an environment for running software applications.

Web server’s role is to serve web pages (static content):
	Nginx, in this setup, serves static web content like HTML files, images, CSS, and JavaScript to
	users' web browsers.

Application server’s role is to compute dynamic content:
	The application server processes requests, executes the codebase, and generates dynamic content 	based on user interactions. It communicates with the database to fetch and manipulate data.

www.foobar.com is an A record because it resolves to an IP address:
	The DNS "A" record associates a domain name (www.foobar.com) with an IP address (8.8.8.8).

The website would be temporarily down when new code is deployed and the web server needs to be r	estarted:
	When new code is deployed, the web server needs to be restarted, causing a temporary period of website unavailability or downtime during the restart process.
