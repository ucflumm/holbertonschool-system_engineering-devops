Explanation of Components:
1. Adding Load Balancer (HAProxy):
	The load balancer distributes incoming web traffic among multiple servers to enhance performance, ensure high availability, 
	and prevent a single point of failure (SPOF).

2. Adding Multiple Application Servers:
	Multiple application servers enable load distribution and redundancy, ensuring that if one server fails, the others can 
	still handle incoming requests.

3. Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:
	The primary-replica setup in the database involves a master node (primary) and one or more replica nodes (slaves). 
	The primary node handles write operations, while replica nodes replicate data from the primary for read operations, 
	ensuring data redundancy and fault tolerance.

4. Explanation of Load Balancer Configuration:
	The load balancer is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm, which evenly distributes incoming requests among 
	the application servers in a cyclic manner. This helps in load distribution without taking server load into account.

5. Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:
	The setup with multiple active application servers (all serving traffic simultaneously) is an Active-Active configuration. 
	Active-Passive involves one active server handling traffic while the others remain in standby until the active server fails.

6. Difference Between Primary and Replica in Database:
	The primary node handles write operations (insert, update, delete) on the database, while replica nodes replicate data 
	from the primary and handle read operations. Replicas can take over if the primary fails.

### Issues with this Infrastructure:
1. Single Points of Failure (SPOFs):
	Despite the use of multiple servers, there might still be SPOFs in the load balancer, database, or servers due to 
	misconfigurations or hardware failures.

2. Security Issues (No Firewall, No HTTPS):
	Lack of a dedicated firewall and absence of HTTPS can expose the infrastructure to potential security threats, 
	including unauthorized access, data breaches, and interception of sensitive information.

3. No Monitoring:
	Absence of monitoring systems makes it difficult to track performance, detect issues, and respond to potential failures
	or security breaches promptly.

Improvements to this infrastructure might involve implementing redundancy in critical components, adding a firewall for security, incorporating HTTPS encryption, and introducing monitoring systems for performance and security monitoring.
